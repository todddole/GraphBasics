This is an assignment template for Hardin-Simmons CSCI-3323 Data Structures Course.

Your assignment is to implement the WeightedDirectedGraph class data and methods so that the tests pass.

While we will not use weights in this assignment, we will reuse this code for future assignments that include weights.  So be sure to implement a data structure that stores the weights!

Notice that this is also a directed graph, so edges are one directional.
